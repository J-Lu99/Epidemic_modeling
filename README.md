# Epidemic_modeling
A compendium of notebooks with the necessary tools for modeling and simulation of epidemics (working or not on networks), including direct applications.
Extracted from Dr. Lage Castellanos' course, expanded with my code and direct applications.

Here you can find (see the index in the file):

- Modeling of different types of epidemics
- Modeling algorithms.
- Fundamentals of graph programming.
- Network epidemics
- Specific tools for modeling epidemics in Python.
- Comparisons with analytical results.
- Real application programming.
